Urban Delay Tolerant Network Simulator (UDTNSim v0.1)
----------------------------------------------------

Urban Delay Tolerant Network Simulator (UDTNSim) is platform for 
carrying out experiments on mobility models and communication 
protocols for Delay Tolerant Networks in road networks. 

Pre-requisites for UDTNSim
---------------------------
UDTNSim is developed using Python-2.7. The following libraries need to 
be installed before proceeding with the execution of the simulator.
1. Numpy
2. Tkinter

How to execute the simulator?
------------------------------

The main file of the simulator is 'main.py' provided in the root 
directory. Execute 'main.py' using Python with required settings in 
the configuration file 'sim.config'.

A detailed documentation of the simulator is available at the link:
